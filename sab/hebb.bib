abstract="Coupled oscillatory activity recorded between sensorimotor regions of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop is thought to reflect information transfer relevant to movement. A neuronal firing-rate model of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, however, has dominated thinking about basal ganglia function for the past three decades, without knowledge of the relationship between basal ganglia single neuron firing and cortical population activity during movement itself. We recorded activity from 34 subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons, simultaneously with cortical local field potentials and motor output, in 11 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing awake deep brain stimulator lead placement. STN firing demonstrated phase synchronization to both low- and high-beta-frequency cortical oscillations, and to the amplitude envelope of gamma oscillations, in motor cortex. We found that during movement, the magnitude of this synchronization was dynamically modulated in a phase-frequency-specific manner. Importantly, we found that phase synchronization was not correlated with changes in neuronal firing rate. Furthermore, we found that these relationships were not exclusive to motor cortex, because STN firing also demonstrated phase synchronization to both premotor and sensory cortex. The data indicate that models of basal ganglia function ultimately will need to account for the activity of populations of STN neurons that are bound in distinct functional networks with both motor and sensory cortices and code for movement parameters independent of changes in firing rate. Current models of basal ganglia-thalamocortical networks do not adequately explain simple motor functions, let alone dysfunction in movement disorders. Our findings provide data that inform models of human basal ganglia function by demonstrating how movement is encoded by networks of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons via dynamic phase synchronization with cortex. The data also demonstrate, for the first time in humans, a mechanism through which the premotor and sensory cortices are functionally connected to the STN.",

abstract="The efferent projections of the ventral pallidum in the rat were studied using anterograde tracing of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde tracing of choleratoxin subunit B. The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum. In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area. Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula. In the mesencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the retrorubral area, the median raphe nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the peribrachial area, the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus. The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum. Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum, located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure. Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon, i.e. the dopaminergic cell groups A10, A9 or A8, or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum. The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area, whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets. The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum, the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized. The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral, a dorsal-to-ventral and, to a lesser degree, a rostral-to-caudal topography. With respect to the subthalamic region, the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Further AVT efferents descend to the medial half of the midbrain tegmentum including an anterior region of the median raphe nucleus, to the ventral half of the central grey substance including the dorsal raphe nucleus, to the parabrachial nuclei, and to the locus coeruleus. Similar injections centered in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNC) label fibers that are distributed in the striatum in an orderly medial-to-lateral arrangement, and almost entirely avoid the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. With the exception of the lateral quarter of the substantia nigra, which apparently does not project to the extreme rostral pole of the striatum, each small SNC locus, regardless of its anteroposterior localization, distributes nigrostriatal fibers throughout the length of the striatum. Descending SNC efferents are distributed to the same general regions that receive descending AVT projections, except that no SNC fibers appear to enter the locus coeruleus. Isotope injections confined to the pars reticulata (SNR) label sparse nigrostriatal fibers, and numerous nigrothalamic fibers ascending mainly to the nucleus ventromedialis and in lesser number to the parafascicular nucleus and the paralamellar zone of the nucleus mediodorsalis. Descending SNR fibers leave the nigra as a voluminous fiber bundle that bifurcates into a large nigrotectal and a smaller nigrotegmental component, the latter terminating largely in the pedunculopontine nucleus of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of TGC. The subjects included 90 patients with schizophrenia and 90 healthy controls. We compared the TGC results between the groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to adjust for age and sex and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to examine the discrimination ability of delta to gamma frequency bands and TGC. Patients with schizophrenia showed a significant increase in the resting-state TGC at all 19 electrodes. The analysis of the ROC curves for each frequency band exhibited relatively low classification accuracies for the delta, theta, slow alpha, fast alpha, and beta power. The TGC generated the most accurate results among the electroencephalography (EEG) measures, with an overall classification accuracy of 92.5\%. The resting-state TGC value was increased in patients with schizophrenia compared to that in healthy controls and had a higher discriminating ability than the other parameters. These findings may be related to the compensatory hyper-arousal patterns of the dysfunctional default-mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. Therefore, resting-state TGC is a promising neurophysiological marker of schizophrenia.",

abstract="Dynamic networking of brain regions is suggested to be one of the key factors involved in various brain computations. Central executive function typically requires instantaneous coordination among the medial prefrontal regions and other distant regions, depending on the on-going task situation. In human scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), the medial prefrontal area is estimated to be the current source of the theta rhythm, while there is no direct evidence that the theta rhythm is involved in the dynamic networking of central executive circuits. Here we hypothesize that the central executive circuit over the prefrontal and task-related cortices is dynamically linked by theta synchronization. By using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG, we elucidated cortical circuits emerging with theta phase synchronization during free pacing repeated subtraction. Theta phase synchronization in the scalp EEG was found to emerge at two major clusters of electrode pairs, between the right frontal and left parietal sites and between the frontal and right parietal sites. The phase synchronization of two clusters is accompanied by fMRI responses in the cortical regions responsible for central executive function, working memory, visual imagery and cognitive action sequence. Here we report the first evidence that theta phase synchronization dynamically coordinates the central executive circuits, including the medial prefrontal cortex and relevant cortical regions.",

The early phases of expression are mediated by a redistribution of AMPA-type glutamate receptors: More receptors are added to potentiate the synapse or receptors are removed to weaken synapses. With time, structural changes become apparent, which in general require the synthesis of new proteins. The investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these forms of synaptic plasticity has received much attention, because NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD may constitute cellular substrates of learning and memory.",

abstract="The brain processes information through multiple layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but complicates learning because it is difficult to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all the synaptic weights on each neuron's axon and further downstream. However, this involves a precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we demonstrate that this strong architectural constraint is not required for effective error propagation. We present a surprisingly simple mechanism that assigns blame by multiplying errors by even random synaptic weights. This mechanism can transmit teaching signals across multiple layers of neurons and performs as effectively as backpropagation on a variety of tasks. Our results help reopen questions about how the brain could use error signals and dispel long-held assumptions about algorithmic constraints on learning.",

abstract="The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in cognitive tasks such as working memory, decision making, risk assessment and regulation of attention. These functions performed by the PFC are supposed to rely on rhythmic electrical activity generated by neuronal network oscillations determined by a precise balance between excitation and inhibition balance (E/I balance) resulting from the coordinated activities of recurrent excitation and feedback and feedforward inhibition. Functional alterations in PFC functions have been associated with cognitive deficits in several pathologies such as major depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. These pathological situations are correlated with alterations of different neurotransmitter systems (i.e., serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), acetylcholine\ldots) that result in alterations of the E/I balance. The aim of this review article is to cover the basic aspects of the regulation of the E/I balance as well as to highlight the importance of the complementarity role of several neurotransmitters in the modulation of the plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We illustrate our purpose by recent findings that demonstrate that 5-HT and DA cooperate to regulate the plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses targeting layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PyNs) of the PFC and to fine tune the E/I balance. Using a method based on the decomposition of the synaptic conductance into its excitatory and inhibitory components, we show that concomitant activation of D1-like receptors (D1Rs) and 5-HTRs, through a modulation of NMDA receptors, favors long term potentiation (LTP) of both excitation and inhibition and consequently does not modify the E/I balance. We also demonstrate that activation of D2-receptors requires functional 5-HTRs to shift the E-I balance towards more inhibition and to favor long term depression (LTD) of excitatory synapses through the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3$\beta$ (GSK3$\beta$). This cooperation between different neurotransmitters is particularly relevant in view of pathological situations in which alterations of one neurotransmitter system will also have consequences on the regulation of synaptic efficacy by other neurotransmitters. This opens up new perspectives in the development of therapeutic strategies for the pharmacological treatment of neuronal disorders.",

We have examined the initial steps required for the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in CA1 pyramidal cells by repetitive low frequency (1 Hz) synaptic stimulation. This form of LTD was synapse specific, was saturable, and required activation of post-synaptic NMDA receptors. Loading CA1 cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA prevented LTD, whereas lowering extracellular Ca2+ resulted in the induction of LTD by stimulation that previously elicited long-term potentiation. Following LTD, synaptic strength could be increased to its original maximal level, indicating that LTD is reversible and not due to deterioration of individual synapses. Induction of homosynaptic LTD therefore requires an NMDA receptor-dependent change in postsynaptic Ca2+ which may be distinct from that required for long-term potentiation.",

abstract="Information is stored in neural circuits through long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths. Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), in which synaptic strengths change in a synapse-specific manner. In contrast, little attention has been paid to mechanisms that regulate the total synaptic strength of a neuron. Here we describe a new form of synaptic plasticity that increases or decreases the strength of all of a neuron's synaptic inputs as a function of activity. Chronic blockade of cortical culture activity increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over a 48-hour period mESPC amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were at least partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate, and apparently affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Such 'synaptic scaling' may help to ensure that firing rates do not become saturated during developmental changes in the number and strength of synaptic inputs, as well as stabilizing synaptic strengths during Hebbian modification and facilitating competition between synapses.",

abstract="Complex cognitive behaviors, such as context-switching and rule-following, are thought to be supported by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Neural activity in the PFC must thus be specialized to specific tasks while retaining flexibility. Nonlinear ``mixed'' selectivity is an important neurophysiological trait for enabling complex and context-dependent behaviors. Here we investigate (1) the extent to which the PFC exhibits computationally relevant properties, such as mixed selectivity, and (2) how such properties could arise via circuit mechanisms. We show that PFC cells recorded from male and female rhesus macaques during a complex task show a moderate level of specialization and structure that is not replicated by a model wherein cells receive random feedforward inputs. While random connectivity can be effective at generating mixed selectivity, the data show significantly more mixed selectivity than predicted by a model with otherwise matched parameters. A simple Hebbian learning rule applied to the random connectivity, however, increases mixed selectivity and enables the model to match the data more accurately. To explain how learning achieves this, we provide analysis along with a clear geometric interpretation of the impact of learning on selectivity. After learning, the model also matches the data on measures of noise, response density, clustering, and the distribution of selectivities. Of two styles of Hebbian learning tested, the simpler and more biologically plausible option better matches the data. These modeling results provide clues about how neural properties important for cognition can arise in a circuit and make clear experimental predictions regarding how various measures of selectivity would evolve during animal training.The prefrontal cortex is a brain region believed to support the ability of animals to engage in complex behavior. How neurons in this area respond to stimuli-and in particular, to combinations of stimuli (``mixed selectivity'')-is a topic of interest. Even though models with random feedforward connectivity are capable of creating computationally relevant mixed selectivity, such a model does not match the levels of mixed selectivity seen in the data analyzed in this study. Adding simple Hebbian learning to the model increases mixed selectivity to the correct level and makes the model match the data on several other relevant measures. This study thus offers predictions on how mixed selectivity and other properties evolve with training.",

title = {Dopamine, uncertainty and TD learning},
abstract = {Substantial evidence suggests that the phasic activities of dopaminergic neurons in the primate midbrain represent a temporal difference (TD) error in predictions of future reward, with increases above and decreases below baseline consequent on positive and negative prediction errors, respectively. However, dopamine cells have very low baseline activity, which implies that the representation of these two sorts of error is asymmetric. We explore the implications of this seemingly innocuous asymmetry for the interpretation of dopaminergic firing patterns in experiments with probabilistic rewards which bring about persistent prediction errors. In particular, we show that when averaging the non-stationary prediction errors across trials, a ramping in the activity of the dopamine neurons should be apparent, whose magnitude is dependent on the learning rate. This exact phenomenon was observed in a recent experiment, though being interpreted there in antipodal terms as a within-trial encoding of uncertainty.},

title = {Modeling functions of striatal dopamine modulation in learning and planning},
abstract = {The activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is strikingly similar to the reward prediction error of temporal difference reinforcement learning models. Experimental evidence and simulation studies suggest that dopamine neuron activity serves as an effective reinforcement signal for learning of sensorimotor associations in striatal matrisomes. In the current study, we simulate dopamine neuron activity with the extended temporal difference model of Pavlovian learning and examine the influences of this signal on medium spiny neurons in striatal matrisomes. The modeled influences include transient membrane effects of dopamine D(1) receptor activation, dopamine-dependent long-term adaptations of corticostriatal transmission, and effects of dopamine on rhythmic fluctuations of the membrane potential between an elevated "up-state" and a hyperpolarized "down-state". The most dominant activity in the striatal matrisomes is assumed to elicit behaviors via projections from the basal ganglia to the thalamus and the cortex. This "standard model" performs successfully when tested for sensorimotor learning and goal-directed behavior (planning). To investigate the contributions of our model assumptions to learning and planning, we test the performance of several model variants that lack one of these mechanisms. These simulations show that the adaptation of the dopamine-like signal is necessary for sensorimotor learning and planning. Sensorimotor learning requires dopamine-dependent long-term adaptation of corticostriatal transmission. Lack of dopamine-like novelty responses decreases the number of exploratory acts, which impairs planning capabilities. The model loses its planning capabilities if the dopamine-like signal is simulated with the original temporal difference model, because the original temporal difference model does not form novel associative chains. Transient membrane effects of the dopamine-like signal on striatal firing substantially shorten the reaction time in the planning task. The capability for planning is improved by influences of dopamine on the durations of membrane potential fluctuations and by manipulations that prolong the reaction time of the model. These results suggest that responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli contribute to sensorimotor reward learning, novelty responses of dopamine neurons stimulate exploration, and transient dopamine membrane effects are important for planning.},

abstract = "{The induction of associative synaptic plasticity in the mammalian central nervous system classically depends on coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. According to this principle, associative homosynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission can be induced only if synaptic release occurs during postsynaptic depolarization. In contrast, heterosynaptic plasticity in mammals is considered to rely on activity-independent, non-associative processes. Here we describe a novel mechanism underlying the induction of associative LTP in the lateral amygdala (LA). Simultaneous activation of converging cortical and thalamic afferents specifically induced associative, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-dependent LTP at cortical, but not at thalamic, inputs. Surprisingly, the induction of associative LTP at cortical inputs was completely independent of postsynaptic activity, including depolarization, postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation or an increase in postsynaptic Ca2+ concentration, and did not require network activity. LTP expression was mediated by a persistent increase in the presynaptic probability of release at cortical afferents. Our study shows the presynaptic induction and expression of heterosynaptic and associative synaptic plasticity on simultaneous activity of converging afferents. Our data indicate that input specificity of associative LTP can be determined exclusively by presynaptic properties.}",

abstract = "{RATIONALE: Impaired ability to shift perceptual attentional set forms a core feature of schizophrenic illness and is associated with prefrontal cortical dysfunction. A pharmacological model producing equivalent deficits in rodents may enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for effective treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the effects of phencyclidine (PCP) administration on performance in a rodent attentional set-shifting task and the neural correlates of PCP-induced deficits in task performance. METHODS: Twenty-four hours following acute administration of 2.58 mg/kg PCP or vehicle, rats were tested on a perceptual attentional set shifting task (Birrell and Brown in J Neurosci 20:4320-4324, 2000). Following completion of the task, in situ hybridisation was employed to detect concurrent regional alterations in zif-268 and parvalbumin mRNA expression. RESULTS: PCP administration selectively decreased the ability of rats to shift attentional set between perceptual dimensions (extra-dimensional shift, EDS). This impairment was accompanied by, and correlated with, decreases in expression of zif-286 in the infralimbic cortex and of parvalbumin in the dorsal reticular nucleus of the thalamus. CONCLUSION: Acute administration of PCP produces deficits in perceptual set shifting comparable to an aspect of executive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, this impairment is associated with altered medial prefrontal cortical and reticular thalamic activity. Therefore, this rodent paradigm may model the set-shifting deficits that form a core feature of schizophrenic pathology.}",
