\begin{abstract}
  Recent advances in neurophysiology suggest that a neural network can
  transmit two separate signals with distinct functions, via
  cross-frequency coupling. We propose that one signal carries
  behaviourally relevant activity and the other an error signal
  controlling plasticity, and this allows error-based learning in such
  a deep network. We have embedded this network in a closed loop
  scenario, where an error signal is propagated \textsl{forwards} from
  its input via its deeper layers to its output, with the goal of
  minimising the error signal. We demonstrate its performance with a
  1st person shooter game.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
There is strong neurophysiological evidence that different brain
oscillations enable the brain to carry separate information via the
same synapses and neurons in a forward fashion
\cite{Canolty2010}. These streams, represented by different frequency
bands, control plasticity in specific ways, with the higher frequency
components affecting plasticity \cite{Bliss73}, and the lower ones
being relevant for behaviour \cite{Luescher2012} while keeping
plasticity constant. This means that error signals are propagated in a
forward fashion from the inputs of the network to its outputs,
altering plasticity while progressing through the network.

On a system level, brain decision networks such as the striatum
are strongly modulated by an error signal in the form of dopaminergic
innervation \cite{Schultz97}, but their cortical targets receive very
little dopamine \cite{Groenewegen1993}. This poses a problem of how
higher level decision-making receives errors whilst also showing more
flexibility than rigidly aiming for a reward. A single reward
prediction error cannot account for the large behavioural flexibility
that higher animals and humans show.

Propagating errors from the input to the output is the realm of
reinforcement learning, in which actions feed back from the
environment and then are evaluated with the help of sensor
inputs\cite{Verschure91,Dayan1992,Sutton88,Sutton98,Abbott01,Woergoetter2005}.
In the simplest case an error signal can be achieved by a reflex
\cite{Verschure91,PorrNecoInvco2003}, where the agent reacts to
unexpected changes in their environment. In the language of control
\cite{Phillips2000} this means that a desired state should be
maintained as closely as possible. The difference between the desired
state and the actual state is the error signal of the control loop,
and can be used not only to trigger a behavioural action but also fed
into a neural network. We demonstrate this in our novel architecture.

In this paper we present a novel deep network algorithm for closed
loop systems called ``Deep Feedback Learning'' (DFL) -- this
propagates an error signal in a forward fashion through its
network. The input is directly driven by the error signal, but the
deeper layers receive weighted sums of the error from the previous
layers.  We demonstrate this in a 1st-person shooter game using
Vizdoom.

    deep neuronal network, which has inputs $V_i$ that predict the
    disturbances. The network tries to pre-empt these disturbances and
    generate an appropriate action $V_k$. The transfer functions here
    are indicated with capital letters and are in the sampled
    z-domain.
    \label{closed_loop}}
\end{figure}

\section{Closed loop learning}
Before we describe the algorithm, we need to place it in a simple and
instructional closed loop context. Fig.~\ref{closed_loop} shows the
entire closed loop system, with the deep feedback learning as a black
box for now. The idea is that we have a fixed closed loop which is
able to fend off disturbances, such as an unexpected bend on a road or
the sudden appearance of an enemy. This fixed loop then takes
appropriate action to solve this disturbance, e.g. correcting a car's
steering, targeting food or aiming towards and shooting an enemy. In
formal terms we have a setpoint $SP$ which compares the input of
organism to a desired input. If the input deviates from the setpoint
an action is generated with the transfer function $H_0$. This action
then eliminates the disturbance $D$ and arrives via the environmental
transfer function $P_0$ at the input again; thus, the loop is
closed. The reason why we have chosen a feedback loop because it
generates an \textsl{error signal}. The error signal is
non-zero if a disturbance has happened, and this can be used to tune
our deep feedback learning network.

In order to tune our network it receives additional inputs which are
able to predict the disturbance, and thus prevent the trigger of the
feedback loop. These additional inputs are provided via $V_i$ where we
have shown one pathway and possible additional inputs as a dashed line
in Fig~.\ref{closed_loop}). For example a video camera or eyes can
provide images of the way ahead, or of an enemy prior to
attacking. Our algorithm has the task of using the error signal to
tune its network and to minimise this error, as described next.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \caption{A) Network overview. With the exception of the input layer, every
    neuron is a composite cell with an activation $v$ and an error
    term $e$. These are propagated through the network in a weighted
    fashion in parallel.  B) Computation in a single composite cell.
    The presynaptic activities $v_j$ and error signals $e_j$ are used
    to perform correlation based learning and change the weight
    $w_{jk}$ which weights for both activity and error propagation into the next
    layer. The contents of the dotted box only exist for the deeper
    layers as also illustrated on the left with the input layer
    having only activities $v$, but no errors. \label{netw_together}}
\end{figure}


\section{Deep feedback learning}
We define a network with an input layer, hidden units and an output
layer which can all have different numbers of neurons (see
Fig~\ref{netw_together}A). In contrast to traditional
networks, every layer (except for the input layer) consists of two
summation nodes: the actual activity and an error signal. These
are processed in two parallel streams.

Let us first focus on the network activity. We define a multi-layered
network, where every neuron in any layer is a standard computational unit that
calculates a weighted sum $v_k$ of its inputs $v_j$ and then applies
an activation function $\Theta(x) = \tanh(x)$:
\begin{equation}
  v_k = \Theta\left( \sum_j w_{jk} v_{j} \right) \label{act_sum}
\end{equation}
The activity flows from neurons in layer $v_j$ to neurons in
layer $v_k$ multiplied by the weights $w_{jk}$, and this
is then repeated in the next layer. For a network with
$N$ layers we have then $N-1$ sets of weights $w_{jk}$. Note that these
indices are just examples and we start with $i$ for the 1st layer and then
$j$ and so on.

The weight changes are then updated in a semi-Hebbian fashion:
\begin{equation}
  w_{jk}(t+1) = w_{jk}(t) + \gamma v_j(t)  e_k(t) + \mu \Delta w_{jk}(t) \label{learningRule}
\end{equation}
where $v_j(t)$ is the presynaptic activity and $e_k(t)$ is an error
signal attached to the postsynaptic neuron, so the correlation is
calculated between input signals and the error signal, with the
standard parameters learning rate $\gamma$ and momentum $\mu$.

We now describe the error signal propagation. As outlined above, the
error signal emerges from the feedback loop, and is injected into the
network at the 1st hidden layer as the ``postsynaptic'' activity. The
weight change for this 1st layer can then be calculated directly with
Eq.~\ref{learningRule} by setting $e_k$ to the error signal of the
feedback loop (see Fig.~\ref{closed_loop}).

For the deeper layers, the error signal is computed as a weighted
sum of the error signals from the previous layer:
\begin{equation}
  e_k = \frac{\left( \sum_j w_{jk} e_{j} \right) \Theta^\prime (v_k) }{\frac{\sum_j {|w_{jk}|}}{\sum_j 1}}
  \label{deepError}
\end{equation}
where the $\Theta^\prime (v) = 1 - v^2$ is the derivative of the
activation function $\Theta(v)$: this limits learning when the unit
approaches saturation, as in backprop. The norm guarantees that
the error propagates through all layers and does not vanish from
layer to layer due to small weights.

A simplified data flow diagram of the learning performed in each layer
is shown in Fig~\ref{netw_together}B, where we see the two processing
streams: both the activity $v_j$ and error signal $e_j$ are weighted
by $w_{jk}$, and summed separately in the next layer. Remember that
for the 1st hidden layer, the error is just the error signal
directly injected from the feedback loop. The diagram omits the error
normalisation, scaling and activation derivative in order to focus on
the main point that learning happens between the error signal and the
presynaptic activity.

Learning is therefore performed in three steps: first the activity is
propagated through the network, then the error signal is propagated
via the \textsl{same} weights, and finally the weights are adjusted. Thus,
both the error signal and the activity are propagated in a forward
fashion. Learning itself can be interpreted as \textsl{heterosynaptic} for the
activity $v_j$ and \textsl{Hebbian} for the error $e_j$.


\section{Derivation of the learning rule}
We start from the assumption that a single neuron using heterosynaptic
plasticity is able to eliminate an error signal
\cite{Porr2006ICO}. Because of the exploding complexity of closed loop
learning we focus here how an error signal $X_0$ should be propagated
to deeper layers from its input by using the approach in
\cite{Mehta1986}, taking partial derivatives in the z-space and
assuming that weight development in time is slow in comparison to the
closed loop dynamics.  Let us assume two layers $j$ and $k$ where the
input signals to the deep network are signals with index i so that we
have $V_i, V_j$ and $V_k$. The error signal, $X_0$ (see
Fig.~\ref{closed_loop}), can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  X_0 = \frac{P_0 \left[ V_k V_J + D z^{-1} \right]}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
\end{equation}
where $V_k$ and $V_j$ are transfer functions of the layers $k$ and $j$
respectively. We know that a weight change $\Delta w$ calculated by
correlating $X_0$ with an input $V_i$ leads to convergence in a closed
loop system \cite{Porr2006ICO}. This can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta w_{ij} = X_0(z) V_i(-z)
\end{equation}
We now need to show that if we have deeper weights such as $w_{jk}$
that these will change in the same way as those of the input layer. In
order to establish this, we look at small weight changes in $w_{jk}$
and relate them to the input weights $w_{ij}$.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial w_{jk}} =
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial V_j}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    \frac{\partial V_k}{\partial w_{jk}}
\end{equation}    
where
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial X_0}{\partial V_j} = \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
\end{equation}
If we assume for now that the layers consist only of linear neurons:
\begin{eqnarray}
  V_k &=& \sum_j w_{jk} V_j \\
  V_j &=& \sum_i w_{ij} V_i
\end{eqnarray}
then this yields:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial w_{jk}} &=&
    \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    V_j \\
                                        &=&
    \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    \sum_i w_{ij} V_i
\end{eqnarray}    
  We can now multiply this equation with $V_i(-z)=V_j^-$ to indicate a correlation, yielding:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial w_{jk}} V_i^- =   
    \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    \underbrace{\left( \sum_{i^\prime} w_{i^\prime j} V_{i^\prime} \right)}_\textrm{\tiny deep layer error signal} V_i^-
\end{equation}
This means that if we introduce a small change in the deeper weights
$w_{jk}$ they will depend on the weighted covariance at the input
where this correlation at the input propagates, weighted by the input
weights $w_{ij}$, to the deeper layer $w_{jk}$. This shows that the
error signal is propagated in a weighted fashion to deeper
layers. Note that this is not a stability proof but rather the
derivation of the network structure, using a similar trick to deep
learning but in closed loop and forward fashion. For a stability
analysis one needs to take into account for the non-linear activation
functions and unroll the partial derivative $\frac{\partial
  V_j}{\partial V_k}$, whose derivative depends again on the entire
closed loop. However, this is not of practical relevance because the
environmental transfer function is rarely known which leads us to
the shooter game.
    
\section{Shooter game}
In this scenario, we try to learn to play a first-person shooter
purely from visual inputs. We use the Vizdoom
(http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/) environment for this purpose, and
train a controller to play against a single pretrained bot from Intel
that ran in the Vizdoom 2016 competition. The setup was as follows:

The images returned from Vizdoom are RGB 160x120. We rendered the
enemy in blue, and formed a reflex signal by finding the bounding box
of the pixels closest to that colour. Note that the reflex is slow and
also inherently noisy, as other events in the game are also rendered
blue (e.g. the ‘flashes’ that happen at respawns). The reflex also
fails at times when the enemy is too distant or too close to the
camera. For learning, we only supply the network with the greyscale
image (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}D) flattened into a vector of $19200$
inputs, so it is forced to discover purely spatial cues. The reflex is
computed relative to the image centre, so a negative value implies the
enemy is on the left. Shooting behaviour is entirely hardwired: if an
enemy is detected within a threshold of the image centre, the bot
fires. Note that the bot's only actions are to rotate in the plane,
and shoot -- it does not translate (but the enemy does). To generate
the rotation we have a single value produced by 3 neurons acting at
different sensitivities:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \theta = g_{err}\, \mathrm{error} + g_{net} \left( 10 v_0 + 3 v_1 + v_2 \right)
\end{equation}
where $v_0, \ldots, v_2$ are the network outputs, and $\Delta \theta$
is the change in orientation.

          and G was 0.0001.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Results}
As before, we see that the controller outputs steadily increase over
time (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}E). With a high value of $g_{net}$,
the bot can make very rapid aiming movements. This has the advantage
that the error can in principle be reduced very quickly; it also
causes the bot to sometimes make large rotations even when the enemy
is out of the field of view, which helps with exploration. On the
other hand, it can cause the aiming to overshoot and oscillate around
the target. The weight growth is intermittent due to the discontinuous
nature of the error signal (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}G) but stabilises
because the long term average error converges to zero. The different
scales are likely due to the inputs having more dimensions.

A popular performance measure in gaming is how often the bot is killed
vs how often it kills the enemy. This is called the kill/death ratio,
and we plot some smoothed KD curves in Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}F. To
do statistics, we measure the time taken to reach a threshold KD of
0.15 - Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}B shows this as a function of
learning rate. There is a stable region in the middle where
learning is consistently successful. We also plot the smoothed KD for
the final step of each trial(Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}A); although a
noisy measure, the same pattern emerges. Over time, the input weights
blur the background, leaving dark and light blobs to detect the enemy
and generate an aiming response (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}D).

Note that this is only one skill of a functioning FPS bot, as a real
bot would require additional skills such as seeking rewards
(e.g. finding health packs) and navigating the environment
(e.g. avoiding collisions). Future research will investigate whether
the DFL approach can be used to acquire such skills, for example,
by utilising the reward prediction error generated by TD learning.


\section{Discussion}
We have shown that a deep network which propagates its errors in a
forward fashion from its inputs to its outputs is able to solve closed
loop learning tasks. We have demonstrated this in a first person
shooter game.

Plasticity has always been hotly debated in neurophysiology -- the
general understanding is that a large postsynaptic Calcium
concentration causes LTP \cite{Malenka99,Bennett2000} and a low one
causes LTD \cite{Mulkey1992}. This requires a strong presynaptic drive
to achieve a strong postsynaptic activity, and with that Calcium
influx \cite{Meunier2017}. In mathematical terms this would just lead
to self-amplification of the synaptic weight, where strong presynaptic
activity would cause greater postsynaptic activity and in turn
stronger weights, and so on. However, suppose the learning signal and
the actual activity were transmitted via the same synapse but were
fundamentally separated \cite{Lindsay2017}, for example by using
different frequencies: high frequency potentials could cause
plasticity changes via high frequency potentiation (HFP) while low
frequency potentials propagate behaviourally-relevant activity
\cite{Canolty2010}. DFL can provide here a mechanism that allows
stable behaviourally-relevant learning driven by heterosynaptic
plasticity and Hebbian learning for the error signal, with the
stability arising from the fact that it is constantly corrected by the
error signal.

Looking at a system-wide perspective, one can see DFL as a flexible
actor which has a high degree of freedom in generating actions, as long as they
minimise the error. For example in the basal ganglia the striatum is
seen as an actor receiving an error signal via dopamine, the well known
reward prediction error \cite{Schultz97} which is understood as being
closely related to the error of temporal difference (TD) learning
\cite{gurney98:_basal_gangl_action_selec_devic}. It is curious that
the striatum receives the error signal but both downstream neurons in
the basal ganglia and upstream in the cortex receive much less
dopaminergic modulation \cite{Beckstead1979}. However, plasticity is
not just limited to the striatum, but happens in all brain areas, so
it makes sense to propagate this error signal further into the cortex
\cite{Groenewegen1993} where high level decision-making takes place.
In the language of TD learning \cite{Sutton87} this means that we
have a distributed actor where the first layer is modulated by the
reward prediction error, and then the following stages, that project
back to the cortex, use instead cross frequency coupling
as described above \cite{Lipski2017}.

Given that the error is propagated from the input to the output, the
novel aspect here is that the more layers DFL has, the more remote it
is from the immediate error feedback. This allows for increased
flexibility which is then a function of the number of layers, and
creates an actor which is far less rigid than a standard Q-learner
\cite{Dayan1992}. The actions can be substantially varied as long as
the error signal can eventually be minimised, and the variability will
be more pronounced with more hidden layers. In other words, the more
hidden layers we have, the more behavioural flexibility the agent will
show. In a biological context this means that as cortical processing
takes over in the deeper stages, it also can develop more flexibility
while still receiving \textsl{distributed} error signals rather than a
global one.

A different stance about synaptic plasticity (and ultimately how
autonomous agents learn) has been taken by the deep learning
community, which has recently claimed that error backpropagation is
biologically realistic \cite{Lillicrap2016,Roelfsema2018}. This has
been demonstrated in an abstract network with one hidden layer by
introducing a separate feedback pathway from the output of the network
to this hidden layer, but this does not take account the
cortico-striatal network mentioned above \cite{haber95}. While this
shows promising results for abstract models of biologically inspired
decision making, the implied brain connectivity is not faithful to
neurophysiological findings (see \cite{berthoud04} for an extensive
review).

While we have turned error propagation upside down to use it in a
closed loop context, \cite{Guo2014} takes a different direction, and
present an approach that still uses backprop to solve closed loop
problems. To turn the open loop backprop into a closed loop algorithm,
they embed it into Q-learning which is itself closed loop. However,
even given its major performance advances, the main drawback is the
discrete state space, which makes it hard to solve analogue problems,
and Q-learning is not biologically realistic when compared to the
biological evidence outlined above.
